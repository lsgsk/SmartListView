# SmartListView
This is a project of the ListView which supports random zoom, gestures, and inertial scrolling. It is inherited from the AdapterView class, and applies IAdapter. 
The adapter presents quick scrolling with the creation of thumbnails followed by the background loading of high-quality images without the heap.
SmartListView inherits the interface of AdapterView thus being able to work with a random adapter. Seekbar is present.
